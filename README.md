# Estimate-Distance-from-Webcam-and-Blink-Detection
Development of a Windows Software for estimating the Distance from a Person to a Webcam and Blink Detection using Computer Vision and Face Recognition Techniques (Tkinter_Python)


This Windows program measures your distance to the monitor using a webcam and sends a notification if you get too close.
Also, this program is able to detect blinking and counts the number of blinks and warns you with a notification if you blink less than 10 per minute.
Also, this program includes a stopwatch and uses face detection to measure the time when you are facing the monitor.
